    <h1>The Wrong Choice</h1>
<p>Why do I make the wrong choice? <br> I feel like I lost my voice <br> Why do I make things worse? <br> I want to scream out and curse.</p>
<p>Why do I make the wrong choice? <br> I want to rejoice <br> Why do I always feel bad? <br? I wish later I'll be glad. </p>
<p>Why do I make the wrong choice? <br> I'm starting to devoice <br> Why do I feel like crying? <br> An the worst part is I'm always sighing
