    <h1>Love All Around</h1>
<h2>By: Nirjhana Paul </h2>

</body>
	  <p>I know while I look at the stars <br>It will start to heal my scars <br>The stars and I are connected <br>Just as to be expected </p>
	  <p>The love goes back and forth <br>From this point henceforth <br>Hearing your sound, <br>Let our love go all around </p>
	  <p>I miss you terribly all day <br>There is so much I want to say <br>Your beauty speaks within <br>All I want to do is grin
          <p>I would hate to see you disappear <br>And I would keep hoping you would reappear <br>You are a part of me <br>Like we were meant to be </p>
